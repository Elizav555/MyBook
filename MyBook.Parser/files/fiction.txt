        "description": "Meet Bill Murdoch, the world's most reluctant private investigator… This box set contains all three books in the Bill Murdoch Mysteries series, each a perfect piece of modern crime fiction which will grab you and keep you guessing until the very last line. Tense and taut, smart and sharply-observed, this series is a 'cracking new addition to the Aussie crime genre'. HEADLAND (Book #1) What happens when a drug dealer is forced to turn detective? Meet Bill Murdoch, the world's most-reluctant private investigator... Murdoch’s doing just ﬁne, thanks for not asking. He’s dealing drugs for a crime syndicate in Sydney and saving for a house by the sea. But what does he think life is, a fairy tale? As the syndicate puts pressure on him to fill the shoes of his murdered boss, Murdoch is cornered by an equally formidable foe: the Australian Tax Ofﬁce demanding an explanation for his sizeable cash income. Murdoch spins a beautiful lie, telling tax inspector, Hannah Simms, he’s a private detective. When Simms asks him to investigate the mystery of her niece's disappearance, Murdoch grabs what he thinks is a golden opportunity to outrun the syndicate. But his arrival in the missing girl's small coastal home town causes an unexpected stir and the reluctant PI soon realises his troubles are only just beginning... CLASS ACT (Book #2) ** Nominated for Best Australian Crime Fiction [Ned Kelly Awards, 2018] ** Can a man who’s lived a life of crime ever escape his past? The world’s most reluctant private investigator is about to find out... Former bad boy turned local hero, Bill Murdoch, should be happy with his little piece of paradise. After all, he’s got the fancy car and the big house by the beach. The only trouble is he’s slowly suffocating in small town life. So when Murdoch is hired to investigate who framed wealthy businessman, James Harte, with the murder of a glamorous young woman, he jumps at the chance. Going undercover among the jet set, Murdoch is quickly drawn into an exciting world of yachts, horse racing and glitzy parties. But soon Murdoch’s shady past looks set to catch up with him and when he falls for Harte’s beautiful wife, Amanda, things take a deadly turn... BASE NATURE (Book #3) How far can you push a man before he reveals his base nature? Bill Murdoch is about to find out… Murdoch takes on two cases in as many days. First he is hired to find local man, Scott Patterson, the victim of a mysterious abduction. Then an impressive stranger arrives in town with a tempting offer. But has Patterson really been abducted? And is the stranger all he appears to be? As Murdoch gives in to temptation and risks everything by returning to his old criminal ways, the hunt for Scott Patterson takes an unexpected turn. Soon Murdoch and his partner, Davie Simms, are dragged into a depraved underworld of human trafficking, prostitution and torture, where they will find evil on their doorstep, and face a desperate fight for their lives... _____________________________________ PRAISE FOR THE MURDOCH BOOKS: \"Gillmore is a great author and knows how to make the characters and setting really interesting\" -- Book Addict's Reviews \"A lot of the success of HEADLAND is down to the character of Bill Murdoch. Dry as a chip, determined, understandably daft at times, he's a survivor first and foremost, but a decent bloke all the same. There's nuance and substance to everyone in this book...this is an extremely promising Australian thriller, PI noir debut\" -- Aust Crime \"[Murdoch] is a guy that is more than capable of handling himself in tough situations and is now on my list of favourite PI's!\" -- BookieWookie _____________________________________ Set in Sydney and small-town Australia, the books in this series are enjoyed by fans of Mick Herron, Peter Temple, Barry Maitland, Ragnar Jonasson, Erik Hamre, Jane Harper, Garry Disher, Mari Hannah, Dave Warner, Pete Brassett, and Iain Rankin's Rebus novels.

Prequel: The Promise Will this race car driver and debutante be able to hold on to their love when reality comes knocking? Book 1: The Surprise Wedding Sometimes exes come in handy. Devon Mattson’s week couldn’t get much worse. Not only is he fake engaged to the woman who broke his heart a decade ago, but his goal of saving his hometown of Blueberry Springs has become dependent on the two of them playing nicely. Will a fake engagement help them overcome their painful past and lead them back to love once again? Book 2: A Pinch of Commitment When falling in love isn’t part of the contract. Chef Lily Harper grew up tagging along after Ethan who saved her from bullies, mud puddles and being an outsider. When Lily flees a nasty ex who won’t take a hint, she comes running home to Blueberry Springs, striking a deal with her childhood protector, Ethan. If he marries her, she’ll take his restaurant off his hands, giving him more time to spend on his dream tech business. It seems like an ideal agreement…until she begins to fall in love with the man who’s made it clear his heart will never be part of their fake marriage deal. Book 3: The Wedding Plan Falling in love wasn't part of the plan. They've promised their past mistakes won't impact their secret wedding plan. They’ve promised not to kiss…not to fall in love.
